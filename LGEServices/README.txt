LGEServices - (c) 2011 - The CyanogenMod Project
--------------------

This is a wrapper package for LGE's services.jar additions, and the
necessary helper natives, derived from the source made available at
opensource.lge.com.

The original com.lge.* classes are LGE's, but modified to remove the bits
that require unavailable proprietary classes. Any complaints with regard
to them malfunctioning should be directed to CM, or to myself.
